  <h3>Plugin upgrades</h3>
  <p>Most plugins don't receive nearly the amount of testing and auditing as WordPress core</p>
  <p>Read upgrade notices and do your research on plugin updates, <em>especially</em> if you're testing on production</p>

  <h4>What happens if something goes wrong?</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Revert the plugin upgrade</li>
    <li>Post a support ticket on the plugin's WordPress.org page
      <ul>
        <li>Premium plugins sometimes offer separate support methods</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>If a developer doesn't know an issue exists he/she can't fix&nbsp;it!</strong></li>
  </ul>
